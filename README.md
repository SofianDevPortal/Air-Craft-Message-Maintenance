# Air-Craft-Message-Maintenance

This project involves identifying relationship between two types of messages from an avionics system. The first is Maintenance Messages (MMSG) and the other is Flight Deck Effect (FDE).
I used a Word2Vec model to capture the vector space embeddings of the messages and find the relationship between by finding the co-occurence matrix. This model was carried out on Python and SQL.
